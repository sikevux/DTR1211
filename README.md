Well this is my public repo for strange things concerning the Databashantering course that I'm going to take 2011/2012. It's mandatory for the ones taking Naturalsciences with the Math and data focus.

Basically it's about learning SQL, and we will most likely be forced to use MSSQL and VisualBASIC, so that's why I use Perl and MySQL.
