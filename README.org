Well this is my public repo for strange things concerning the
Databashantering course that I'm going to take 2011/2012. It's
mandatory for the ones taking Naturalsciences with the Math and data
focus.


Basically it's about learning SQL, or rather Microsoft Access 2010,
that's why I use python(or perl(or php)) + sqlite(or MySQL)
